# KTH_DeepLearing

This repository contains my final project for the course DD2424: Deep Learning in Data Science (7.5 credits), which I attended during my exchange semester in Stockholm. The course covered key machine learning methods applied to computer vision and natural language processing tasks. For this project, we trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to generate Shakespeare-like text, demonstrating the application of deep learning techniques to creative text generation.
